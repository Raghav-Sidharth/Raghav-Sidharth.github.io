      <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
      <p id="answer">Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognise your own emotions and their impact on others while being empathetic to those around you. Understanding your feelings, recognising them, and labelling them can give you a broader range of emotions to help you better manage different situations. This can also lead to better control of said emotions, more discipline, and better management of relationships. Empathy for others, the ability to relate or understand someone’s point of view, can provide a more nuanced understanding of your peers and communicate more effectively. </p>

      <p id="question">How is EQ different to IQ?</p>
      <p id="answer">While IQ may be correlated with success, it is not the determining factor for success. IQ is the theoretical measurement of someone’s intelligence, the general cognitive factor. While IQ is determined/measured by someone’s ability to solve problems. EQ relates to a person’s ability to manage relationships with the self and peers. Often for success in the workforce, if people can build relationships and connect with their peers on an emotional level (understanding of their emotions), their likelihood for success is higher than if someone is technically competent. This isn’t to say IQ is not required, it is desirable to be knowledgeable, but that isn’t the end all be all. </p>

      <p id="question">Why is EQ important?</p>
      <p id="answer">A person’s ability to build relationships, be empathetic and control emotions often lead to a more measured and confident person. At the same time, it may be easy for some, but everyone can learn it. People like to be heard and connect with others on a deeper level, and being able to do so can open more opportunities for them.</p>
