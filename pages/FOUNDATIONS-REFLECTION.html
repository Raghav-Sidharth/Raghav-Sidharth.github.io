      <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>


      <p id="question">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</p>
      <p id="answer">I can get distracted quite quickly, which hampers my learning ability.
        I spend too long overthinking a problem, and when I don’t find a solution, I get frustrated.
        I must be more patient and take time to understand the concepts we have learnt. 
        </p>

      <p id="question">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>
      <p id="answer">Being patient with myself, helping others where I can and taking time to reflect on my achievements and shortcomings have helped me get to where I am today. I do believe if I continue to challenge myself and continue to work on areas I can improve upon, I will gain a better understanding of myself and reach the goals I have set for myself. </p>

      <p id="question">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
      <p id="answer">My ability to reflect and pick up on certain tendencies that mitigate my learning process, and identify these things, has been vital to the days I feel confident versus the days I feel less than capable. Learning JS has been the most complex process to wrap my head around, regardless of the good and bad days. It’s been a critical challenge to keep progressing to a more stable career. In tandem with core, I feel more able to identify points to improve, practice, and deal with negative emotions. I hope to try and find more opportunities to work with my fellow cohort to help aid my learning process. </p>

      <p id="question">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
      <p id="answer">Having to discuss and think about my identity, strengths, and values. Sharing these details was never easy and having to think about and share them as part of a blog post was even more difficult but I am glad I did it. </p>

      <p id="question">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
      <p id="answer">It’s challenging to learn so many of these complicated concepts quickly. We must be able to understand what our limitations can be and how our emotions can play a factor in our ability to learn. I have felt, at times, my limitations and am slowly learning how to use them to my advantage or find ways to mitigate them.  They’ll always be there but if I am aware of them, it will be easier to learn going into boot camp. </p>

      <p id="question">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
      <p id="answer">It has been a valuable learning experience and something I haven’t experienced with other courses. Focusing on our mental health is always a net positive for a student’s experience. This kind of learning will play a more important role as myself and fellow students progress through our coding journey/careers.</p>
