      <h2>Neuroplasticity & Growth Midset</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="question">What is Neuroplasticity? </p>
      <p id="answer">Neuroplasticity is the ability of our brains to change and adapt based on different experiences. Until the latter half of the 20th century, it was believed that our brains were static, that neuroplasticity only manifested during early childhood. It is now believed that our brain’s neural networks can continually grow, create new pathways, reorganise, and adapt. </p>
      <p id="answer">There are two main types of neuroplasticity; functional plasticity allows the brain to move certain functions from a damaged area to other undamaged areas. In instances of strokes, the brain may move certain functions to allow healthy parts of our brain to take over. It is important to note that there are limitations; severe injuries to our movement, language, and cognition may not recover as these are functions controlled by specific parts of the brain. Structural plasticity allows our brains to change because of learning; this is the type of neuroplasticity we will discuss today. </p>
      <p id="answer">Structural plasticity is an ongoing process and is highly dependent on environmental factors. Learning environments that offer challenges and focused attention are valuable opportunities for our brains to grow. Reading, travelling, and creativity are promising avenues for us to stimulate our brains to grow. It is also believed that getting plenty of rest allows our neurons to make more connections, allowing them to transmit more information from one to another. Regular physical activity also dramatically benefits our mental and physical health; it prevents the degradation of our hippocampus, a part of our brain involved in memory and other functions. Exercise can also improve our basal ganglia a part of the brain that controls motor function and learning. </p>

      <p id="question">Growth Mindset</p>
      <p id="answer">A growth mindset believes your skills and abilities can be developed over time. Challenging yourself and taking steps forward to learn and create opportunities for success. In a learning environment, we must take each challenge step by step and explore where we are struggling and why. We should be able to stay composed in an uncomfortable place; if we can’t solve a problem, we will. We just haven’t figured it out yet.  </p>
      <p id="answer">The last few sprints have been a challenge, to say the least. But upon researching this topic and reflecting on the preceding sprints, it’s been interesting to learn the points where I had applied my growth mindset. Going through these challenges and the more I practised the more I learnt the more I was challenged the more I sought a solution by reaching out, researching, and trying solutions to problems. </p>
